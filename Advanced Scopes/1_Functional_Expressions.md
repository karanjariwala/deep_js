# Function Expressions


Line 1 is a red marble [function declaration] (within enclosing scope).
Line 3 _myTeacher_ is a red marble.
However, _anotherTeacher()_ is a blue marble [function expression] (within their own scope).


Hence line 9 will give _Reference Error_ as it’s not red, it’s blue.


Function expression is also **read-only**.
